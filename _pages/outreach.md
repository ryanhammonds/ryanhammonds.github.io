Outreach
========

In addition to research, our lab is avid about data and science communication and outreach online
(such as on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bradleyvoytek), and in *real life*. We love our science
and our jobs and want to share with others our enthusiasm for the wonder of scientific discovery.
<br>
Professor Voytek speaks at events ranging from elementary schools to venues such as
[TEDx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki24i6NPic0),
[@GoogleTalks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZRXrOq1T08),
[Foo Camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp), and
[SciFoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foo_Camp). His writing and research has appeared in

Professor Voytek is also known for his, uh... "research" into the zombie brain.
This silly, tongue-in-cheek way of tricking people into learning about the brain lead to the
publication of his book, [Do Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21981632-do-zombies-dream-of-undead-sheep),
with his friend and collaborator [Timothy Verstynen](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/people/verstynen.html),
Professor of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. It was reviewed in both
[Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/557.1.full) and
[The Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laneur/PIIS1474-4422%2814%2970320-5.pdf),
according to whom we are apparently, "patient and thorough teachers... with an ingenious touch of
conscious nerdy sophistication."
This "research" has appeared on
[TED-Ed](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/diagnosing-a-zombie-tim-verstynen-brad-voytek),
[Wired](http://www.wired.com/2011/06/zombie-apocalypse-science), the
[Academy of Neurology](http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2011/08040/Two_Self_Proclaimed_Neuroscience__Geeks__Decipher.8.aspx),
[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/10/23/explaining-the-neuroscience-of-the-zombie-epidemic/),
[Slate](http://www.slate.fr/story/45069/zombies-science),
NPR, and [New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/guides/everything/zombies/).
