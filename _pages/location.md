Location
========

Our labs are located in two locations on the main campus at UC San Diego in awful La Jolla
(see picture below). We occupy the North wing of the second floor of the Social Sciences Research
Building (SSRB) as well as several offices in the
[Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/), located in the
[San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/).
