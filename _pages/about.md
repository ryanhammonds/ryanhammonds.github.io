About Us
========

Our lab *primarily* studies neural oscillations—or "brain waves". Despite them being one of the
first-ever signals observed in the human brain back in 1929, we know surprisingly little about where
neural oscillations come from, what they do, or even if they're functional or "accidental".

Neural oscillations are correlated with nearly every aspect of healthy brain function and
neurological/psychiatric disease, ranging from memory, attention, and motor control to depression,
Alzheimer's disease, and ADHD. Despite this, our lab steps back, beginning from two very simple
questions:

1. How do we measure and quantify oscillations, and;
2. Where do they come from? Starting from those questions, we build our work forward to learn about
   the functional/computational role that oscillations play in human cognition, aging, and disease.

We do this from two complementary angles. From the experimental side, we conduct human cognitive
experiments while recording either non-invasive electrical brain activity using EEG, or invasively
by working with patients undergoing brain surgery (usually for epilepsy). We also collaborate
extensively with researchers in a variety or other domains, and make considerable use of publicly
available brain data (which we help catalog [here](https://github.com/OpenLists/OpenData)).

We combine these experimental approaches with large scale data-mining, data science approaches,
and machine-learning techniques to discover neural features—oscillatory and otherwise—that are
informative of cognitive states.

From the computational side, we develop new methods for measuring and quantifying neural
oscillations in both the time- and frequency domains (see our
[publications]({{ "/publications" | relative_url }}) for our latest research). We also build models
of neural circuitry to probe the computational capabilities of neural populations to investigate how
oscillations impact computation and communication. Additionally, we model how these circuits
contribute to the electrical brain signals we record. We validate these models by comparing to a
wide range of electrophysiological data, including single-unit recordings and intracranial field
potentials from humans and animals.

Ultimately, our research goal is to bridge these two approaches and construct an understanding of
cognition built on the first principles of neurophysiology. Rather than asking, “What brain regions
correlate with working memory or attentional load?” we ask, “Given what we know about the
computational properties of neurons and neural systems, how can neural systems interact to give rise
to cognitive phenomena we equate with ‘attention’ and ‘working memory’, and what are the behavioral
and cognitive limitations and consequences of these biological constraints?”

In collaboration with his wife, Jessica Bolger Voytek, Voytek built and published brainSCANr, an
algorithmic approach to aggregating information from more than 2 million peer-reviewed neuroscience
articles. This project was his first attempt at automated science: using machine-learning tools to
algorithmically generate novel hypotheses. Our philosophy with regards to the role of data-driven
approaches to neuroscience is that large scale data analytics can complement and guide in-lab
experimental research, but should not replace it.
