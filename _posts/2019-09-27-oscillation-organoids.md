Lab PhD student Richard Gao has written about our latest paper, Complex Oscillatory Waves Emerging
from Cortical Organoids Model Early Human Brain Network Development,
[published in Cell Stem Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(19)30337-6).
This work was recently featured in the *New York Times*!

It’s an amusing, honest look at what has been a long—but scientifically fascinating—collaboration.

Give it a read over on his [blog](http://www.rdgao.com/oscillating-organoids/)!
